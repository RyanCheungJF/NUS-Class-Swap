# Task Manager App for CVWO Application 2022

What Yi Shiong (652A) and I (251L) have came up with at the end of a day.

Telegram Bot to handle tutorial/ lab class swappings.

Still a work in progess with text commands at the moment.

Hope to add in inline-buttons and to add in more mods soon.

Hosted on Heroku for now but needs more testing.
